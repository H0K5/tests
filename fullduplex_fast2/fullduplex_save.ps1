# Build methods to create filestream to HID device (stage 1 work)
#################################################################

# Test case: Am I able to split away stage1 (keyboard typeout) from
# stegae to (loaded via HID) after having several drinks (Whisky)
# ToDo: LinkLayer has to flow in from stage 2, stage 1 nnéeds simple
# proto to fetch stage 2
# Idea: let connection syncing deliver payload in in heartbeat by alternating read/write without
# sending right ACK (nobody understands that)
# Idea 2: heartbeat (length 0) respond with payload
